/*
    Highlight Kebutuhan:
    1. Mengambil field penting dari tabel transaksi (invoiceno, stockcode, tanggal, quantity, unitprice, customerid, country).
    2. Melakukan agregasi per customer untuk menghitung:
       - total_orders   : jumlah order unik per customer
       - total_sales    : total penjualan (quantity * unitprice)
       - total_qty      : total kuantitas produk yang dibeli
       - total_products : jumlah produk unik yang pernah dibeli
       - last_order_date: tanggal transaksi terakhir
       - lifespan       : umur customer dalam bulan (selisih order pertama dan terakhir)
    3. Segmentasi customer:
       - VIP     : lifespan â‰¥ 12 bulan dan total_sales > 5000
       - Regular : lifespan â‰¥ 12 bulan dan total_sales 0â€“5000
       - New     : selain kondisi di atas (baru / belum 12 bulan)
    4. Menghitung recency (recency_months):
       - Selisih dalam bulan antara tanggal hari ini (CURRENT_DATE) dengan last_order_date.
    5. Menghitung metrik tambahan untuk analisis:
       - avg_order_value   : rata-rata nilai order (total_sales / total_orders)
       - avg_monthly_spend : rata-rata spending bulanan (total_sales / lifespan)
    6. Filter customer yang valid:
       - hanya menampilkan customer dengan total_sales > 0 (agar fokus pada pembeli yang benar-benar melakukan transaksi).
