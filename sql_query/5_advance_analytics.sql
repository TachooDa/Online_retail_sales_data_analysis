/*
    Highlight Kebutuhan:
    1. Mengambil field penting dari tabel transaksi (invoiceno, stockcode, tanggal, quantity, unitprice, customerid, country).
    2. Melakukan agregasi per customer untuk menghitung:
       - total_orders   : jumlah order unik per customer
       - total_sales    : total penjualan (quantity * unitprice)
       - total_qty      : total kuantitas produk yang dibeli
       - total_products : jumlah produk unik yang pernah dibeli
       - last_order_date: tanggal transaksi terakhir
       - lifespan       : umur customer dalam bulan (selisih order pertama dan terakhir)
    3. Segmentasi customer:
       - VIP     : lifespan ≥ 12 bulan dan total_sales > 5000
       - Regular : lifespan ≥ 12 bulan dan total_sales 0–5000
       - New     : selain kondisi di atas (baru / belum 12 bulan)
    4. Menghitung recency (recency_months):
       - Selisih dalam bulan antara tanggal hari ini (CURRENT_DATE) dengan last_order_date.
    5. Menghitung metrik tambahan untuk analisis:
       - avg_order_value   : rata-rata nilai order (total_sales / total_orders)
       - avg_monthly_spend : rata-rata spending bulanan (total_sales / lifespan)
    6. Filter customer yang valid:
       - hanya menampilkan customer dengan total_sales > 0 (agar fokus pada pembeli yang benar-benar melakukan transaksi).

    - total_orders → jumlah order unik produk tersebut
    - revenue → total pendapatan (SUM(quantity * unitprice))
    - total_sales → pembulatan revenue

    - total_customers → jumlah customer unik yang membeli produk
    - last_order_date → tanggal terakhir produk pernah dibeli
    - lifespan_in_months → umur produk dalam bulan (selisih order pertama dan terakhir)
3. Metrik tambahan:
    - avg_order_revenue → rata-rata pendapatan per order (revenue ÷ total_orders)
    - avg_monthly_revenue → rata-rata pendapatan bulanan produk (revenue ÷ lifespan_in_months)
4. Segmentasi produk:
    - berdasarkan revenue → Low, Medium, High
5. Filter valid:
